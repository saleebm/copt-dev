# Source Coverage Map

**Source axiom:** Axiom 22. Every artifact in the workspace carries a provenance header. Every Anti-Pattern, Failure Mode, Operator card, and Smell Tag in this skill traces back to a source — a real session, a sibling skill, an AGENTS.md rule, or a verified git-internals quirk.

This reference is the master provenance index. When extending the skill (adding a new pattern), the new pattern must trace back to a source documented here.

---

## Provenance header (artifact-level invariant)

Every file in `.repo_janitor_workspace/` opens with:

```yaml
---
produced_at: 2026-05-08T17:00:00Z
produced_by: triage-merger
source_phase: 5
confidence: 0.92
inputs_hash: sha256:abc123...
---
```

The header makes "stale artifact mistaken for authoritative" impossible. A fresh agent re-entering the workspace knows exactly what produced what, when, and from what inputs.

## Source corpus (master index)

Every pattern in this skill traces to one or more of these sources:

## Adding new patterns

When the skill is extended (a new pattern is observed, a new failure mode discovered):

1. **Identify the source.** Was it a real session (cass-mined)? A sibling skill? An AGENTS.md rule? A git-internals quirk?
2. **Cite the source** in the pattern's documentation (operator card, smell rule, anti-pattern, etc.).
3. **Add the source** to this map (under Sessions / Sibling skills / AGENTS.md / Git internals as appropriate).
4. **Add to the QUOTE-BANK** with a §n anchor.

A new pattern without a documented source is a speculative addition; the skill maintainer marks it as such and validates against future runs before promoting.

---

## Why provenance matters

1. **Auditability**. A reader can trace every recommendation to its origin.
2. **Stability**. When a source pattern shifts (e.g., a sibling skill's operator name changes), the impact is traceable.
3. **Calibration**. When a pattern fails in practice, knowing its source helps the maintainer decide whether to soften the rule, find a stronger source, or remove it.
4. **Skill quality**. Patterns with strong provenance (multiple independent sources confirming the same lesson) are more reliable than single-source patterns. The QUOTE-BANK §n entries that have anchors in 3+ sources are the most load-bearing.

---

## Stale source detection

When a source becomes stale (e.g., a sibling skill is removed or substantially refactored, an AGENTS.md rule changes), the maintainer:

1. Marks affected entries with `[STALE — see updated reference]`.
2. Doesn't delete the original (audit trail).
3. Adds a new entry citing the updated source.
4. Updates dependent operators / patterns / axioms to cite the new entry.

The QUOTE-BANK has the same stale-detection convention.

---

## When to add to this map

Every reference file's "Source:" or "Sources:" line should ultimately point to an entry here. If a reference cites a source not in this map, either:

- The source is too informal (a single conversation; a guess) — strengthen with a real reference, OR
- The source is real but not yet documented — add it here.

This is the contract: every "Source: X" line in the skill points to a verifiable line in this file.
